Please answer the below Data Structure Questions:

why do we need data structure?
    Ans: It allows information to be organized efficiently. it's used in almost every program
         or software  system.

List out the areas in which data structures are applied extensively?
    Ans: Compiler Design, Operating System, Database Management System, Statistical Analysis Package,
         Numerical Analysis, Graphics, Artificial Intelligence and Simulation.

what is an Array?
    Ans: A container that holds a number of values of a similar type.

what is the difference between the Array and ArrayList?
    Ans: Array is a fixed length while ArrayList is a variable length collection class.
         Array list can change based on how full it is.

what is LinkedList?
    Ans: a linear data structure where each element is a separate object.

what is queue?
    Ans: it's an interface that represents a list of objects. It's meant to have elements
         inserted at the end of the queue and elements removed from the beginning.

what is stack?
    Ans: a structure that allows for data to be inserted and removed. You can use the peek
         operation to preview data and pop to remove the data. It's goverened by FILO-LIFO.

what is FILO and LIFO?
    Ans: First In Last Out. The First data inserted will be the last data popped from the stack
         Last In First Out. The last chunk of data inserted will be popped first.

what is the order of complexity?
    Ans:
what is the best case to search an element from an array?

what is the worst case to search an element from an array?

what is tree in data structure?
    Ans: An abstract data type or structure that simulates a hierarchical tree structure

what is graph in data structure?
    Ans: a pictured repressentation of a set of objects where some pairs of objects are connected by links.

what is the difference between the HashTable and HashMap?
    Ans: Hashtable is synchronized and hashmap is not.  hashmap's iterator is fail-safe, but hashtable isn't.

What are the major data structures used in the following areas : RDBMS, Network data model and Hierarchical data model.
    Ans: Tree, Array of structures, Graph

How HashMap works in java?
    Ans: Hashmap uses key hashcode to find bucket location and returns the necessary value
         object for the key. It is an array of objects.

What is ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in java? When it occurs?
    Ans: used to indicate that an array has been accessed with an illegal index. The index is either negative
         or greater than or equal to the size of the array.

What are the different ways of copying an array into another array?
    Ans: shallow copy, deep copy

What is difference between an array and a linked list?
    Ans: LinkedList has a dynamic size while array is fixed. also insertion and deletion are easier in LinkedList

What is DFS and BFS?
    Ans: BFS (breadth first search) is a vertex-based queue. useful for finding the shortest path.
         DFS (Depth first search)  is edge-based, stack. Works for both directed and undirected graphs. constructs a
              depth-first forest of several depth-first trees. Often a subroutine for another algorithm.

What is Recursion?
    Ans: it's a way for a method to call itself to solve a problem. A method that does this is called recursive.

What is Big-(O)-notation?
    Ans: It is used to describe performance or complexities of algorithms. It can describe a worst-case scenarios
         and execution time required or use of space in the memory by the algorithm.

Outlined different kind of sorting algorithm with time complexity?
    Ans:  selection sorting
          marries the functions of searching and sortingduring each pass, the unsorted
          element with the smallest/largest value is moved to its proper place in the array. the number of times the
          sort passes through the array is one less than the number of items in the array.Â  in the selection sort, the
          inner loop seeks out the next smallest (or largest) value and the outer loop places that value into its proper
          location.

          Insertion sorting
          Passes only once
          Think of it as what you hold in your hand in a game of poker or go fish


          bubble sorting
          Bubble arrays have multiple passes until everything is correct. usually sorting in ascending or descending order.

          Quicksort or "partition-exchange". is a fast sorting algorithm uses divide and conquer algorithm.
          first divides a large list into two smaller sub-lists. Then recursively sorts the sublists.

          Merge  Sort
          Divides the unsorted array into partitions. each partition contains a single element.
          repeatedly merges until one sublist remains, this is the final sorted list.

Draw a table with time complexity in which it will summarize all the data structure feature's advantages and disadvantages.
  a)In terms of Accessing element.
  b)In terms of Inserting element.
  c)In terms of Searching element.
  d)In terms of Removing element.

  Ans:

  Advantages And disadvantages of sorting

  Bubble Sort:

  Advantages-

  The primary advantage of the bubble sort is that it is popular and easy to implement.
  The main disadvantage of the bubble sort is the fact that it does not deal well with
  a list containing a huge number of items.
  In the bubble sort, elements are swapped in place without using additional temporary
  storage.

  Disadvantages-

  The bubble sort requires n-squared processing steps for every n number of elements to be sorted.
  The space requirement is at a minimum
  The bubble sort is mostly suitable for academic teaching but not for real-life applications.

  Insertion Sort:

  Advantages-

  The main advantage of the insertion sort is its simplicity.
  The disadvantage of the insertion sort is that it does not perform as well as other, better sorting algorithms
  It also exhibits a good performance when dealing with a small list.

  Disadvantages-

  With n-squared steps required for every n element to be sorted, the insertion sort
  does not deal well with a huge list.
  The insertion sort is an in-place sorting algorithm so the space requirement is minimal.
  The insertion sort is particularly useful only when sorting a list of few items.

  Selection Sort:

  Advantages-

  The main advantage of the selection sort is that it performs well on a small list.
  The primary disadvantage of the selection sort is its poor efficiency when dealing
  with a huge list of items.
  Because it is an in-place sorting algorithm, no additional temporary storage is
  required beyond what is needed to hold the original list.

  Disadvantages-

  The selection sort requires n-squared number of steps for sorting n elements.
  Its performance is easily influenced by the initial ordering of the items before the
  sorting process.
